Today we started building the tank that will hold the mussels and manipulated seawater.
Worked from 9:45 am to 2:00 pm.

The general steps we took were:

## Setup
1. Drilled holes in PVC pipe that will be used to divert water with a modified salinity into mussel tanks below
2. Laid out 16 containers on a plastic mat under the PVC pipe (8 treatment, 8 control)
3. Glued PVC pipe to the underside of the table (containers underneath the manipulated salinity tank)
4. Zip-tied the air pump nozzle controls to the bottom of the table behind the PVC pipe
5. Attached black tubing to the air pump and the nozzles that will supply air to the containers through filters
6. Clamped tubing to the side of the containers
7. Weighed down the tubing with rocks so that they straightened out
