Today I finished creating the heart rate sensors.
Worked from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm at SDSU.

## Heart Rate Sensor Building
1. Finished crimping and attaching the sensor wires to the white connectors
2. Soldered the other end of the wires to the last 6 circuit boards
3. Made sure that all of the sensors were working and fixed the ones that were not
4. Heat shrink-wrapped the circuit boards
5. Put glue on the ends of the shrink wrap of both the heart rate sensors and the gaping sensors and let them dry overnight
