Today I started attaching the heart rate sensors.
Worked from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm at CMIL.

## Heart Rate Sensors
1. Turned on the program and plugged in the heart rate testing board (with the battery)
2. Pressed serial plotter in the tools tab
3. Grabbed super glue to attach the sensors to the mussels
4. Angled the sensor just below the bump of the dorsal side of the right valve
5. Waited for the program to show a signal
6. Adjusted the sensor if the signal was weak/not there
8. Made sure that the heart rates were logging properly before gluing and placing the animals to the side making sure not to get glue on the valve opening
9. Placed animals back in tank for glue to set (finished 15 today)
