Today I finished attaching the heart rate sensors and started attaching the gaping sensors.
Worked from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm at CMIL.

The general steps I took were:

## Heart Rate Sensors
1. Turned on the program and plugged in the heart rate testing board (with the battery)
2. Pressed serial plotter in the tools tab
3. Grabbed more super glue to attach the blue and purple sensors to the last two mussels
4. Made sure that the heart rates were logging properly before gluing and placing the animals to the side

## Gaping Sensors
1. Unplugged the heart rate testing board and plugged in the gape testing board
2. Grabbed the green gaping sensor cable and the green mussel
3. Attached the gaping sensor on the board (making sure it read ~500)
4. Glued the sensor on the other side of the mussel than the heart rate monitor is
5. Glued the magnet on the opposite side (same side as the heart rate monitor)
6. Marked down the gaping number it was reading (below)

## Gaping base numbers
- Green (Blake Shellton): 147
- Purple (Marshelline): 121
- Blue (Shellina Gomez): 235
- Blue and Red (Shellvester Stallone): 237
- Blue and Orange (Tommy Shellby): 167 (also needs a seal for the part that screws into the box)

Finished sensors are marked with a piece of white tape
