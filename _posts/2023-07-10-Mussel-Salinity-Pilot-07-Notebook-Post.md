Today I finished attaching the gaping sensors.
Worked from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm at CMIL.

The general steps I took were:

## Gaping Sensors
1. Plugged in the gape testing board
2. Grabbed the yellow gaping sensor cable and the yellow mussel
3. Attached the gaping sensor on the board (making sure it read ~500)
4. Glued the sensor on the other side of the mussel than the heart rate monitor is
5. Glued the magnet on the opposite side (same side as the heart rate monitor)
6. Marked down the gaping number it was reading (below)

### Gaping base numbers
- Yellow (Shelline Dion): 138
- Orange (Denshell Washington): 136
- Red (Idina Mendshell): 196 (found half out of water + started doing that weird gaping out of water behavior)
- Brown (Lea Mishell): 148
- Purple + Blue (Shelldon): 106
- Blue + Yellow (Shelly): 220
- White (Nick Cannon): 180
- White + Blue (Shella Swan): 186 (extra one that will remain unplugged)
- White + Green (Mussel Mommy): 270
- White + Purple (Shell Fanning): 141
- Blue + Brown (Ashelly Tisdale): 126
- Blue + Green (Mishell): 190
