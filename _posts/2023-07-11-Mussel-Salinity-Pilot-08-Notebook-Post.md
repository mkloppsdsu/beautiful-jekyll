## Today's Objectives:
- Figuring out what proportion of seawater to fresh will give a salinity of 15 ppt
- Doing the first run of draining the tank overnight (~12 hours)
- Starting to Zspar the sensors down (one side today, other side tomorrow)
Worked from 10:00 am to :00 pm at CMIL.

The general steps I took were:

## Setting Salinity to 15 ppt
1. Tank filled to level 4 with seawater
2. Turned on the mixer and placed YSI sensor in the water (make sure to get any bubbles out!)
3. Wrote down readings after every bucket of fresh water added (takes ~2 mins for readings to stabilize)

### Readings
Water tank at level 4 with only seawater:
- 22.3 C
- 6.61 DO mg/L
- 44837 SPC microS/cm
- 32.31 SAL ppt

Level 4.5 + 1 bucket fresh
- 22.5 C
- 6.74 DO mg/L
- 40038 SPC microS/cm
- 28.46 SAL ppt

Level 5.2 + 2 buckets fresh
- 22.8 C
- 6.85 DO mg/L
- 35650 SPC microS/cm
- 25.00 SAL ppt

Level 6 + 3 buckets fresh
- 23.0 C
- 6.95 DO mg/L
- 31896 SPC microS/cm
- 22.09 SAL ppt

Level 6.8 + 4 buckets fresh
- 23.2 C
- 7.04 DO mg/L
- 28836 SPC microS/cm
- 19.76 SAL ppt

Level 7.5 + 5 buckets fresh
- 23.3 C
- 7.09 DO mg/L
- 26565 SPC microS/cm
- 18.05 SAL ppt

Level 8.2 + 6 buckets fresh
- 23.4 C
- 7.15 DO mg/L
- 24417 SPC microS/cm
- 16.45 SAL ppt

Level 9 + (almost) 7 buckets fresh
- 23.5 C
- 7.20 DO mg/L
- 22512 SPC microS/cm
- 15.04 SAL ppt

4 inches seawater + 5 inches fresh = 15 ppt
Ratio = 0.8 to 1 sea to fresh
6.5 to 8.1 to fill most of the tank

## Tank Draining
- Started draining at 11:03 pm
- Down 1/2 inch after 1 hour, adjusted flow rates to be a little faster

## Zspar
- Started at 11:08 pm
- Zspar on only the heart sensor and magnet
- Allowed to dry for 3 hours
