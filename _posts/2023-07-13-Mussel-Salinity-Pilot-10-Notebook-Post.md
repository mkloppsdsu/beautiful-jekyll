# Today's Objectives:
- gaping gauge measurements
- tank draining and maintaining salinity

## Another tank run
Level 6.5 of just seawater
- 22.6 C
- 7.26 DO
- 51798
- 37.99 ppt

Just above 7
- 22.8 C
- 7.35 DO
- 47417
- 34.36 ppt

Just above 8
- 23 C
- 7.39 DO
- 43796
- 31.41 ppt

Just under 9
- 23.3 C
- 7.42 DO
- 40679
- 28.91 ppt

9.5
- 23.4 C
- 7.45 DO
- 37976
- 26.77 ppt

Just above 10
- 23.6 C
- 7.48 DO
- 35550
- 24.87 ppt

11
- 23.8
- 7.48
- 33438
- 23.23

Just under 12
- 23.9
- 7.50
- 31631
- 21.83

12.5
- 24
- 7.52
- 30045
- 20.62

Just above 13
- 24.1
- 7.55
- 28565
- 19.5

14
- 24.2
- 7.56
- 27253
- 18.52

14.5
- 24.2
- 7.57
- 26430
- 17.90

- need to drain to get to 15 ppt, started with too high of a salinity

drained to 13, filled back to 14
- 24.3
- 7.59
- 25200
- 16.97

15
- 24.4
- 7.61
- 23542
- 15.76 (stopped here)

- started draining at 1:50 pm
- started draining too fast, slowed down the flow rate
- salinity still at 15.76 after 30 mins!

- might be some leakage on the tank
- tank drains quickly at first and then slows down, need to adjust rates
- salinity and temp of seawater seems to vary daily
- need to check multiple times
- how often to feed? (twice a week)
- how do we control for temp? the tank warms up over time after sitting or adding fresh water
