- gaping calibration

worked from 10:30 am to 4 pm at CMIL

## Tank draining
- started w/ level 2.5 of 15.78 ppt from the day before
- filled tank to 6.5 w/ salinity of 30.09 ppt
metrics:
- 22.3 C
- 7.65 DO
- 42086
- 30.09 ppt

temp and DO go up with addition of fresh water

ending metrics at level 13.2
- 23.7 C
- 7.82 DO
- 23202
- 15.54 ppt

started draining at 11:45 am

- level 9 at 3:00 pm
- level 8.5 at 3:30 pm
- drained at a rate of ~2.5 levels every 2 hours (1.25 levels an hour)

# Gaping calibration
