# Today's Objectives:
- tank fill and salinity check
- find a way to keep mussels upright and wires out of the way
- gaping calibration
- feed at the end

I cut holes in the colander so that the wires could be threaded through backwards to keep the mussels upright

worked from 10 am to 3 pm at CMIL
