# Today's Objectives:
- more gape calibration
- fill tank to 3 ppt

starting level 2.5
- 22.2 C
- 7.16 DO
- 41790
- 29.88 ppt

filled to 5 and drained again to get fresh seawater
- 23.1
- 7.11
- 48340
- 35.09 ppt

buckets of fresh water to get to 3 ppt: 19

drained to 10 after 13 buckets
drained to 12 after 17 buckets

- found a tunicate in the mussel tank
- water temp high today! (24+C)
- after 4 buckets we reached 15 ppt
- after 10 buckets we reached 25C and 8.5ppt
- really hard to get to a low ppt from full salinity
- finally below 4 ppt after 20 buckets

after 20 buckets and 2 drainings:
- 25.5 C
- 7.92 DO
- 6415
- 3.85 ppt

flow draining started at 11:50 am

for some reason they really dont want to open today, only got 1 gape measurement

Tank at 1:30 pm level 13.2
- 25.2 C
- 7.99 DO
- 6386
- 3.83 ppt
